# Project Euler

**Project Euler** (named after [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes over 600 problems, with a new one added once every two weeks (except during the summer break). Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. Problems can be sorted on difficulty. A forum specific to each question may be viewed after the user has correctly answered the given question. As of August 2017 Project Euler has about 750,000 users, from all over the world, who have solved at least one problem.

#### Advice

If you have an intent to solve problems then don't look up to the solutions before solve them for your own good.
